<p align="center">Coronate is a web app for managing Swiss-style chess tournaments.</p>

## üßê About

Coronate is a free alternative to pricey professional tournament software. Anyone, even a tournament newbie with a locked-down public-access computer, can use it to run their tournament.

## üèÅ Getting Started

These are the basic steps you'll need to follow to get a development copy of Coronate running on your machine:

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 10. Coronate probably runs on other versions too, but it's not tested on them.

### Installing

#### 1: Grab the code

For most people, the easiest method is to click the "Clone or Download" button on [this project's GitHub homepage](https://github.com/johnridesabike/coronate).

If you have Git installed, you can also run:
```
git clone https://github.com/johnridesabike/coronate.git
```

If you want to make your own changes, then it's recommended to fork the repository on GitHub and clone your forked version.

#### 2: Install the dependencies

Once you have a local copy of the code, run this command in the project's directory to install its dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## üéà Usage

Coronate works completely in your local browser. Running it only requires two commands.

First run this:

```
npm run re:watch
```

*Note: If you're using an editor that can compile Reason code automatically, such as VS Code and [reason-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jaredly.reason-vscode), then you don't need to run `re:watch`*

Then run this:

```
npm start
```

And then open this URL: `http://localhost:3000`.

Because it keeps your data in your browser's storage, be mindful that data loss can happen unexpectedly depending on your settings. The app's "options" page has a button to back up your data in an external file.


To use the standalone Electron version, then run this instead of `start`:
```
npm run start:electron
```
Or if you're on Windows, then run:
```
npm run start:electron-win
```
The Electron functionality is almost identical to the web version. The biggest difference is that it stores your data separately from your browser.

## üîß Running the tests

The current tests are incomplete and only test a few of the most fragile functions.

Just as with using the live version, you need to run `npm run re:watch` first (but not if you're using an editor that compiles Reason automatically).

Then you can run the tests with the command:
```
npm test
```

## üöÄ Deployment 

To create an optimized version that can be uploaded to your own website, run:

```
npm run build
```

To create a standalone Electron app for Mac and Windows, run: 
```
npm run build:electron-all
```

If you're on a Windows system, run this to only build the Windows version:
```
npm run build:electron-win
```


The Windows version is "portable." It has no installer and stores all of its data in the same folder as its executable.

Linux builds have not been tested.
