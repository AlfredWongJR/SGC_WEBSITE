This is a soon-to-be app for managing chess tournaments. I built it to help the chess players at Chattahoochee Valley Libraries, which is where the name comes from.

Goals for this project include:

- Create a free, portable, easy-to-use chess tournament manager for small clubs with limited budget, time, and resources.
- Implement procedures consistent with USCF and FIDE rules.
- Ensure that the software is usable on a wide range of platforms and input methods, including PCs, phones, and screen readers.
- Create readable, documented source code so the larger community can continue to develop new tournament apps as needed.
