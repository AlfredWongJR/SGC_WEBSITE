  The jsConverter is useful for importing and exporting types to JSON or
  indexedDB storage. Yes, you can store the plain JS representation of a Reason
  record without such conversions, but the advantage to the conversions is that
  they enable manual editing of the JSON data. Also, the exact way that Reason
  encodes its records to JS is arbitrary. Changing a field can change how the
  whole record gets encoded. The jsConverter helps to give consistency.

  I have not measured the performance impact of these conversions, but it
  doesn't *seem* to be significant. Most of it happens in asyncronous functions
  anyway.
