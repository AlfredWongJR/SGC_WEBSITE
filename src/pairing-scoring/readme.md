These files are coded specifically for use within the Chessahoochee app, but with an assumption that other tournament apps would be interested in using them in the future. They're purposely less integrated into the rest of the codebase.

The code here is still dependent on other functions within this project, however. I need to work on making them fully resuable for third parties. In particular, it's highly dependent on my chosen structure for the data (see in `../data-types/`). Less opinionated code would probably be better.

It also probably needs to be cleaned up a lot.
