This module is written for use within Chessahoochee, but with the assumption that other Swiss chess tournament apps may be interested in using its functions.

Once it becomes stable, I may be interested in separating it into its own module with a more permissive license like ISC.

Feel free to use the code here for your own app, but be warned that it's **not stable** and I probably can't provide much support.
