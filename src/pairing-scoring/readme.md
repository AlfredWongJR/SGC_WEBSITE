These files are coded specifically for use within the Chessahoochee app, but with an assumption that other tournament apps would be interested in using them in the future. They're purposely less integrated into the rest of the codebase.

Their code is still dependent on other functions within this project, however. Work will be needed to make them fully reusable for third parties.
