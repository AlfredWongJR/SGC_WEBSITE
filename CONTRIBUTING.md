At the moment, this project is so small and unstable that I'm not actively seeking contributions. This will hopefully change soon, once the vision for the end product becomes clearer.

If you're interested, here's my general to-do list:

## API
- Add tie-breaking logic.
- Better bye handling.
- Improve adding or removing players after a tournament has begun.
- Add rating calculations.
- Add I/O for saving and loading data across sessions.

## Housekeeping
- Clean up code.
- Improve test coverage.
- Write documentation.

## Front-end
- Build a functional front-end UI.

## Beyond the horizon
- Add round robin pairings.
- Build an awesome front-end UI.
- Package into a standalone Electron app.
- Publish a web demo.
- Perfect pairing logic.

The code is designed to follow procedures described in the [USCF chess rulebook](http://www.uschess.org/content/view/7752/369/), which makes building it a unique challenge compared to a generic Swiss pairing system. Where applicable, code comments should cite relevant rulebook section numbers.

If you have any questions, just open a new issue.
