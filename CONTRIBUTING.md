## Other types of feedback:

The direction of this project is currently 100% influenced by my own use case. If you would find this project useful but some part of it doesn't play nicely with your needs, let me know! (Via an [issue](https://github.com/johnridesabike/coronate/issues) or an [email](mailto:johnbicyclejackson@icloud.com).) I would like as many people as possible to benefit from the work that went into this.

My own work environment has some very specific (and ususual) conditions which led to the decisions I've made so far for the project. I'm happy to hear from users who must also work in unique environments.
