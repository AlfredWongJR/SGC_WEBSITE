This project is built using Node.js and React, so familiarity with those will come in handy. If you're interested in helping, here's my general roadmap for the different components:

## API

The API (basically everything in [/src/chess-tourney/](/src/chess-tourney/)) is still very unstable, so I'm not actively seeking help for that until I flesh out how the final product will be organized. However, there is one area that *does* need help: pairing logic. Currently, the code will try its best to pair players according to USCF rules. However, it will occasionally paint itself into a corner where the last players to be paired are ineligible because they've played each other previously. I've coded in some safeguards to minimize that from happening, but it's still a common occurance. Any help improving that will be greatly appreciated.

Other API to-dos:

- Improve adding or removing players after a tournament has begun.
- Add I/O for saving and loading data across sessions.
- Improve rating calculations: individual k-factor for players, provisional ratings, and possibly moving to a different engine (e.g. Glicko-2).
- Better bye handling: signups, black/white balance, tie-break logic, etc.

## Front-end

The user-facing interface currently leaves a lot to be desired, but I'm actively making significant changes to it. If you notice any problems with it, you can probably assume I'll fix them soon. I still appreciate feedback though üòÅ

To-dos:

- Improve how ranks and ties are displayed.
- Add a way to remove rounds.
- Add a way to remove players from the roster.
- Add a way to manually match/unmatch players.
- Add pages for managing  global roster outside of individual tournaments.
- Add pages for editing a player and displaying their stats.

## Housekeeping

General to-dos to keep the project's quality high.

- Clean up code.
- Improve test coverage.
- Write documentation.

## Beyond the horizon

These will get done eventually, but is very low priority now.

- Build an awesome front-end UI.
- Package into a standalone Electron app.
- Improve pairing logic.
- Add user options for tie-break methods.
- Add round robin pairings.
- Export API into standalone node module.


The code is designed to follow procedures described in the [USCF chess rulebook](http://www.uschess.org/content/view/7752/369/), which makes building it a unique challenge compared to a generic Swiss pairing system. Where applicable, code comments should cite relevant rulebook section numbers.
